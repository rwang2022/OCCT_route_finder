This is a website that finds OCCT bus lines for Binghamton University Students.
The user provides a start and end stop, as well as a desired departing and arrival time, and the website will display the bus times that fit. 
The results will be filtered to 
1. contain the start and end stop.
2. be available on that weekday.
3. leave after the desired departing time (by default now).
4. arrive before desired arrival time (by default 3 hours from now).
