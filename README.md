# OCCT_route_finder
https://sea-turtle-app-x9tp2.ondigitalocean.app/

This is a website that finds OCCT bus lines for Binghamton University Students. Think of it as a simple Google Maps.
The user provides a start and end stop, as well as a desired arrival time, and the website will display the bus times that fit. 
The results will be filtered to 
1. contain the start and end stop.
2. be available on that weekday.
3. leave after the current time.
4. arrive before desired arrival time.
